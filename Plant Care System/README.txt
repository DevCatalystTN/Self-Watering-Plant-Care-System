DESCRIPTION:
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|This is a program built to monitor the conditions of a plants enviroment, such as temperature and humidity of the air, and the moisture content of the soil.|
|When the soil moisture goes below 50% the pump will turn on and automaticly water the plant until the desired ammount of water is delivered to the soil.    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


DIRECTIONS:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1) Place the soil moisture sensor on the outer edge of one side of the pot. Make sure to fully bury all golden surfaces on the sensor.  |
|2) Place tubing on the opposite side of where the moisture sensor is placed (This is to ensure the entirety of the soil recieves water.)|
|3) Make sure the other end of the tubing is fully submerged in the water container.                                                     |
|4) Run "Start Plant Care System.py"                                                                                                     |
|5) Done! Make sure to check in on your system occasionally to make sure the system does not run out of water.                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

SPECIAL NOTES:
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1) If the pump stays on for too long the system will automatily shut itself down to prevent any exessive overuse of the pump.                         |
|   When/If this happens refil the water container and hold the button down until the system restarts. Now the system should be operating normally.    |
|                                                                                                                                                      |
|2) This system was built for small/medium sized plant pots. Large soil volumes may not work well with this system.                                    |
|                                                                                                                                                      |
|3) On the inside of the box there is a blue knob (a varible resistor) that controlls LCD brightness. This knob can be turned to adjust LCD brightness |
|   to desired levels, although full brightness is not reccomended.                                                                                    |
